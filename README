usbdump is a simple frontend for the linux kernel's usbmon facility.
It aims to summarize and remove irrelevant lines and fields where
possible.

To compile, simply type

	make usbdump

At least one argument is required: the USB device to monitor, specified
by its vid/pid. Use the 'lsusb' command to get a list of these. Basic
usage is thus:

	usbdump -d <vid:pid>

A long sequence of identical output can be summarized by a running
counter instead, by using the -u (unique) option to specify the number
of lines in the output to compare. For example, if a device constantly
polls on one endpoint and receives a reply on another, but both lines
are always the same in an idle state of the device, you can summarize
the output like this:

	usbdump -d <vid:pid> -u 2
